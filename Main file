Hello User, you have reached the Rules and Info for our Brawl Stars club tournament. 
I wanted a sort of website that you could go to if you wanted to see rules instead of digging through posts on a social media platform or such.
This page is not completely finished yet, and I am still deciding rules, scoring, and such. 
I have zero coding experience in any languages besides TI-Basic (coding on calculators)
Therefore, this site will look very barebones until I figure out how to use Github and HTML (Khan Academy should help with this).
This site will, in future, list all rules and regulations for the weekly tournaments for our Club.

Look here for updates; if there are any, they will be here.
I will probably also notify you of any changes via club mail.
